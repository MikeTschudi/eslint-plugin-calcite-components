# @esri/eslint-plugin-calcite-components

ESLint rules specific to Stencil JS projects.

## Installation

Install the following deps in your stencil project:

```bash
npm i @esri/eslint-plugin-calcite-components --save-dev
```

## Usage

`.eslintrc.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "parserOptions": {
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  },
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@esri/calcite-components/recommended"
  ]
}
```

Add a new `lint` script to the `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*{.ts,.tsx}"
  }
}
```

Lint all your project:
```
npm run lint
```

## Supported Rules

- [`@esri/calcite-components/ban-props-on-host`](./docs/ban-props-on-host.md)

This rule catches props/attributes that should be in the encapsulated HTML structure and not on the host element.

- [`@esri/calcite-components/strict-boolean-attributes`](./docs/strict-boolean-attributes.md)

This rule catches boolean props that are initialized in a way that does not conform to the HTML5 spec.

## Recommended rules

```json
{
  "@esri/calcite-components/ban-props-on-host": "error",
  "@esri/calcite-components/strict-boolean-attributes": "error"
}
```
